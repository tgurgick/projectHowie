   - `receiving_2022_reg.csv`

5. **Run analysis** to understand the structure:
   ```bash
   python3 tests/analyze_csv_structure.py data/pff_csv/your_file.csv
   ```

## üí° **Alternative Data Sources**

If you don't have PFF+ access, consider these alternatives:
- **Next Gen Stats** (from NFL) - Separation and cushion data (free)
- **ESPN Advanced Stats** - Route participation metrics (free)
- **Pro Football Reference** - Basic route running stats (free)
- **nfl_data_py** - Limited route metrics (free, already integrated)

## üîß **Customization**

Once you have the CSV files, the import script will:
1. **Analyze the structure** automatically
2. **Map columns** to our expected format
3. **Handle different encodings** and formats
4. **Create player ID mappings**
5. **Import into your fantasy database**

**Ready to download your PFF+ data?** Place the CSV files in `data/pff_csv/` and we'll analyze and import them!

## üìù **Note on Data Access**

This integration is designed for users who already have PFF+ subscriptions and want to enhance their fantasy football analysis with route running data. The system provides tools to import and analyze PFF data but does not provide access to the data itself.
