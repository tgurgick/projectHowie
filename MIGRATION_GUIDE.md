# Migration Guide: Using Enhanced Howie CLI with Existing Databases

## âœ… Full Compatibility

The enhanced Howie CLI is **100% compatible** with your existing fantasy football databases from the original version. No data migration or conversion is needed!

## Accessing Your Existing Data

### Quick Start
```bash
# Check your existing databases
python howie.py ask "Show database info"

# Query your historical data
python howie.py ask "Show me all players in the database"
python howie.py ask "Get Justin Jefferson's stats from 2023"
```

### Database Tools Available

The enhanced CLI includes dedicated database tools to access your existing data:

#### 1. **Database Query Tool**
Query your existing databases using SQL or natural language:
```python
# In chat mode
> Query the PPR database for top 10 RBs by average points
> Show me all games where a player scored over 30 points
> SELECT * FROM player_game_stats WHERE fantasy_points > 25
```

#### 2. **Player Stats Tool**
Get comprehensive player statistics:
```python
# In chat mode
> Get stats for CeeDee Lamb from 2023 season
> Show me Saquon Barkley's performance in weeks 10-15
> Get advanced stats for Tyreek Hill including EPA and CPOE
```

#### 3. **Team Analysis Tool**
Analyze team performance:
```python
# In chat mode
> Analyze the 49ers offense by position
> Show me Cowboys players and their average fantasy points
> Compare AFC West team performances
```

#### 4. **Historical Trends Tool**
Analyze performance trends over time:
```python
# In chat mode
> Show me Josh Allen's trend over the last 8 games
> Analyze Christian McCaffrey's season-long performance
> Compare 2023 vs 2024 trends for Travis Kelce
```

#### 5. **Database Info Tool**
Get information about your databases:
```python
# In chat mode
> Show database summary
> List all tables in the PPR database
> How many player records are in the database?
```

## Database Locations

The enhanced CLI looks for databases in the same location as the original:
- `data/fantasy_ppr.db` - PPR scoring database
- `data/fantasy_half_ppr.db` - Half-PPR scoring database  
- `data/fantasy_standard.db` - Standard scoring database

## Example Workflows with Existing Data

### 1. Season Review Analysis
```bash
# Start chat
python howie.py

> Get all my 2023 data for wide receivers
> Create a chart showing top 10 WR performances
> Generate a report comparing rookie WRs from 2023
> Export the analysis to PDF
```

### 2. Historical Comparison
```bash
> Compare Davante Adams 2022 vs 2023 seasons
> Show me the trend chart
> Project his 2024 performance based on historical data
> What factors contributed to any changes?
```

### 3. Advanced Queries
```bash
> Query: Which players had the highest variance in 2023?
> Show me players who improved most from weeks 1-8 to weeks 9-17
> Find all games where weather impacted scoring
> Generate a SQL query to find breakout performances
```

### 4. Combine Historical with Real-time
```bash
> Get Dak Prescott's 2023 stats
> Compare with his current 2024 performance
> Show me live scoring for today's game
> Project rest of season based on historical trends
```

## Enhanced Features Using Your Data

### Visualizations from Historical Data
```python
> Create a heatmap of RB performances by week in 2023
> Generate trend charts for my roster using last season's data
> Show position group comparisons across all teams
```

### ML Predictions Using Historical Data
```python
> Use 2023 data to project 2024 rookie performances
> Train a model on historical matchup data
> Optimize my lineup based on historical opponent performance
```

### Code Generation for Your Data
```python
> Generate a Python script to analyze my database
> Create SQL queries to find league-winning performances
> Build a custom analysis for keeper league decisions
```

## Database Schema Reference

Your existing databases contain these tables:

### Core Tables
- **players** - Player information (player_id, name, position, team)
- **games** - Game metadata (game_id, season, week, teams)
- **player_game_stats** - Weekly fantasy stats

### Advanced Tables (if populated)
- **player_advanced_stats** - EPA, CPOE, target share, etc.
- **player_route_stats** - Route running data
- **player_scheme_stats** - Man/zone coverage splits
- **fantasy_market** - ADP and ECR data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Database not found"
**Solution**: Ensure your databases are in the `data/` directory:
```bash
ls data/*.db
```

### Issue: "No data returned"
**Solution**: Check the player name spelling or use partial matching:
```python
> Query: SELECT * FROM players WHERE name LIKE '%Jefferson%'
```

### Issue: Want to use a different database location
**Solution**: You can symlink your databases:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/your/fantasy_ppr.db data/fantasy_ppr.db
```

## Advanced Integration

### Custom Queries
```python
# Direct SQL access
> Query: WITH weekly_leaders AS (
    SELECT week, MAX(fantasy_points) as max_points 
    FROM player_game_stats 
    GROUP BY week
  )
  SELECT * FROM weekly_leaders ORDER BY week

# Natural language that converts to SQL
> Show me the highest scoring player each week of 2023
```

### Combining Old and New Data
```python
> Import my current roster from roster.csv
> Compare my current roster with their 2023 performances
> Which of my players improved the most year-over-year?
> Generate a risk assessment based on historical consistency
```
